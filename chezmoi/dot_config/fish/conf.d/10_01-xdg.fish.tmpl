# XDG
# Configures XDG specification environment variables.

# A single base directory relative to which user-specific data files should be written
set -Ux XDG_DATA_HOME "{{ .xdgDataDir }}"

# A single base directory relative to which user-specific configuration files should be written
set -Ux XDG_CONFIG_HOME "{{ .xdgConfigDir }}"

# A single base directory relative to which user-specific state data should be written
set -Ux XDG_STATE_HOME "{{ .xdgStateDir }}"

# A single base directory relative to which user-specific non-essential (cached) data should be written
set -Ux XDG_CACHE_HOME "{{ .xdgCacheDir }}"

# Reconfigure applications to use these XDG-based directories
# ============================================================
# Important: These environment variables must be exported **before** initializing
# any CLI tools, so the tools can read the customized locations.
#
# Example:
# - `atuin init fish | source` in `90_atuin.fish` will read `STARSHIP_CONFIG`
# - Making `90_<name>` prefix ensures the correct order because environment variable that used in cli later in `90_` prefix are already exported in `10_04-env.fish` this ensures the correct configuration is applied before the process starts.

# === CONFIGURATION ===
set -Ux GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config"
set -Ux PROTO_HOME "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/proto"
set -Ux STARSHIP_CONFIG "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/starship/starship.toml" # Change default location for starship configuration

# === DATA ===
set -Ux _ZO_DATA_DIR "$XDG_DATA_HOME/zoxide" # default for 'db.zo' file stored (database for zoxide)
